### AlwaysOnTop

This service provides simple window management, where user can specify certain
window and force it to be always on top. This can be achieved by selecting window
and pressing simultaneously ```WIN``` and ```T``` button (either lowercase or uppercase).
Pressing ```WIN + T``` again on same window, resets this functionality. Selecting
different window to be always on top, automatically resets that capability for previous
one.
