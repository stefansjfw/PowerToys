### AlwaysOnTop

This service provides simple window management, where user can specify certain
window and force it to be always on top. This can be achieved by opening window
system menu (right mouse click on title bar) and selecting `AlwaysOnTop` option.
User can toggle this option, and also change which window has `AlwaysOnTop` enabled.
Only one window at a time can be always on top.
